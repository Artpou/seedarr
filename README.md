**Seedarr** is a free, open-source, self-hosted web app that lets you browse the entire TMDB catalog, search torrents through your indexers, download them with a built-in torrent client, and **stream content directly in your browser** — even while it's still downloading.

Think of it as **Stremio meets Overseerr**, but fully self-hosted and under your control.

## Features

You can retrieve all features and how to configure each one following the documentation: 

[https://seedarr.netlify.app/guides/features/](https://seedarr.netlify.app/guides/features/)

### Browse & Discover

- Full **TMDB catalog** — movies, TV shows, trending, popular, top rated, upcoming
- Rich metadata: trailers, IMDb / TMDB / personal ratings, cast, genres
- Search across the entire TMDB database
- Personalized **Watchlist** and **Likes** to keep track of what you want to watch

### Modules & Integrations

- Unified **Settings → Modules** — TMDB, SUBDL, indexers, storage, social, and notifications
- Indexers: **Torrentio**, **Jackett**, **Prowlarr**, or a custom Stremio addon — with live health status
- Optional **remote storage** (FTP/FTPS or WebDAV) — transfer completed downloads to a NAS, Nextcloud, or any remote server; optional local-library hardlink via `HARDLINK_PATH` (+ optional movie/tv paths, optional `HARDLINK_REMOVE_SOURCE=1` to remove staging files after unload if hardlink succeeded) (works alongside FTP/WebDAV)
- **Letterboxd** import / sync (Trakt, SMB, and Discord/Telegram/Email notifications coming soon)

### Torrent Search & Download

- Search torrents from your enabled indexer modules
- Built-in **WebTorrent client** — no external download client needed
- Real-time download progress, speed, peers, seeds, and ratio
- Pause, resume, and manage downloads directly from the UI
- Quality and language info displayed for each result

### Stream & Watch

- **Stream while downloading** — progressive MP4/WebM can play before the download completes
- Integrated **movi-player** — plays MKV/HEVC/AV1/HDR natively in the browser (no server transcoding)
- Automatic **subtitle detection** from downloaded files (SRT/ASS/VTT)
- **Watch progress tracking** — resume where you left off
- **Next episodes** — season picker and episode carousel under the series player

### Multi-User & Roles

- **Role-based access control**: Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer
- First user becomes the owner — no open registration by default
- Per-user watchlist, likes, and watch history
- **Shared household library** — any authenticated user can browse and stream all downloads; mutations (pause/delete/transfer) require ownership or admin
- **Guided onboarding** for new users

### Self-Hosted & Private

- Runs entirely on your hardware — your data stays yours
- Lightweight **SQLite** database, no external DB required
- **Docker** ready with a single `docker compose up`
- Responsive, **mobile-friendly** design
- Available in **English** and **French**
